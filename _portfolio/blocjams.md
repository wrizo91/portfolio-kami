## Summary

The world is full of music; why should you have to listen to music that someone else chose? In today's on demand world, consumers like to be in control of the content they consume. In the music industry, the days of a select group of disc jockeys controlling what people listen to are over. People want to hear what moves them. The last thing they want are limitations. This is where BlocJams steps in.  BlocJams gives people the opportunity to select music from various genres, backgrounds, and locations. No arbitrary limits. No distractions.   

## Problem
My task at BlocJams was to develop the front end. We wanted to build a dynamic site that would not only be aesthetically pleasing, but also run efficienly. With users jumping from song to song, we needed to build a site that could deal with huge amounts of data and the constant changing of information. Navigating through the DOM as easily and quickly as possible was crucial.


## Solution

To deal with the the huge amount of data, constant changing of information, and the need to quickly and easily manipulate the DOM, we relied on HTML-5 data attributes and jQuery. Data attributes are used to store custom data private to the page or application. They give us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements.The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience. jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery was very helpful in fulfilling the needs of a site like BlocJams. 



## Results/Conclusion

In the end, I believe BlocJams accomplished what we set out to do. The site is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. More importantly, the site runs efficiently. Using jQuery and data attributes, amongst other things, allowed us to build a site that can handle all the needs of a music streaming site. Why don't you give us a try! Visit BlocJams today.
