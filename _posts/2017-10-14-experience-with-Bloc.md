title: Experience with Bloc
---

In the following post I will discuss my experience as a student at Bloc. Bloc is an online education company with intensive mentor-led programs for aspiring developers and designers. Bloc relies on the time-tested apprenticeship model to help students start new careers. They combine experienced mentors and project-based curriculum to offer students around the world a more accessible and effective way alternative to traditional degrees or in-person bootcamps.

My experience at Bloc so far has been great. There are 3 aspects of Bloc I wish to discuss. Each aspect has made the experience worthwhile.

The first aspect I will discuss is the role of the mentor. He or she is an experienced, knowlwdgable web developer who's role is to help you navigate through Bloc's curriculum and help you understand what it means to _be_ a developer. Every week you have a 30 minute meeting with your mentor. During these meetings, you have the ability to discuss whatever it is that you are struggling with. Some weeks it may be the material that you are having trouble understanding, other weeks it may be that you have a question about the how things work in the workplace (real world application). Honestly, without a mentor to help me understand the material, and more importantly help me get a sense of the _real world_ life of a developer, I would be lost. This is probably the _bread and butter_ of the program.

Next, I wish to discuss the curriculum itself. When I began my research to help find the best _coding boot-camp_ for my needs and preferneces, I set out to find a program that was difficult, but not so difficult that it would discourage my eagerness to learn. Bloc has managed to settle in the difficulty sweet spot; not too hard, not too easy. Without question the material is challenging for anyone new to computer programming. However, it is possible to accomplish your goal. Bloc is big on accountability. If you do not take ownership of your studies, you will struggle. I hate to admit it, but I found that out the hard way. Nonethless, Bloc provides all the material necessary to become a respectable web developer.

Finally, I will discuss the _help_ team (student support). The _help_ team at Bloc has been amazing to me. Sometimes life throughs you curve balls you were not expecting. At Bloc, they understand this. When life throughs a tough situation your way, Bloc does whatever they can to help you navigate through and get you back on track. It is easy to tell that Bloc wants you to succeed and will do everything in their power to ensure that you do. 

With experienced mentors, a challenging curriculum, and an excellent student support staff, Bloc has all the ingredients necessary for an exellent learning experience.
